Swift Programming Language Guide (Agent Reference Only)


Introduction to Swift

Swift is a modern, type-safe, multi-paradigm programming language developed by Apple for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development. Swift is known for its readability, safety, and efficiency.


Core Concepts and Syntax

Variables and Constants
	•	Use var for variables and let for constants.

var name = "John"
let age = 25



Type Annotations and Inference
	•	Swift supports type inference, but annotations can provide clarity:

let username: String = "agent_007"
var score: Int = 100



Basic Data Types
	•	Integers (Int)
	•	Floating-point numbers (Double, Float)
	•	Boolean (Bool)
	•	Strings (String)

Examples:

var height: Double = 175.5
var activeUser: Bool = true



Strings
	•	Swift strings support interpolation:

let greeting = "Hello, \(name)! You are \(age) years old."



Control Flow

Conditional Statements
	•	if, else if, else

if score > 90 {
    print("Excellent!")
} else if score > 75 {
    print("Good job!")
} else {
    print("Keep trying!")
}

	•	switch statement for multiple branches:

switch score {
case 90...100:
    print("Excellent")
case 75..<90:
    print("Good")
default:
    print("Needs improvement")
}



Loops
	•	for-in loop:

for number in 1...5 {
    print("Number: \(number)")
}

	•	while and repeat-while loops:

var count = 0
while count < 5 {
    print("Count: \(count)")
    count += 1
}

repeat {
    print("Count: \(count)")
    count -= 1
} while count > 0



Functions and Closures

Functions
	•	Basic function syntax:

func greet(person: String) -> String {
    return "Hello, \(person)!"
}

print(greet(person: "Alice"))

	•	Functions with multiple parameters:

func add(_ a: Int, to b: Int) -> Int {
    return a + b
}

print(add(5, to: 3))



Closures
	•	Closures are anonymous functions:

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let squared = numbers.map { number in
    number * number
}

	•	Simplified closure syntax:

let sortedNumbers = numbers.sorted(by: >)



Structs and Classes

Structs
	•	Value type, automatically copied on assignment:

struct Point {
    var x: Double
    var y: Double
}

let p = Point(x: 10, y: 20)

Classes
	•	Reference type, supports inheritance:

class Vehicle {
    var speed: Double

    init(speed: Double) {
        self.speed = speed
    }

    func drive() {
        print("Driving at \(speed) mph")
    }
}

class Car: Vehicle {
    var brand: String

    init(speed: Double, brand: String) {
        self.brand = brand
        super.init(speed: speed)
    }

    override func drive() {
        print("Driving a \(brand) at \(speed) mph")
    }
}

let car = Car(speed: 70, brand: "Tesla")
car.drive()



Optionals and Unwrapping
	•	Optional types can contain a value or nil:

var optionalName: String? = "Agent Smith"
optionalName = nil

Safe unwrapping with optional binding:

if let name = optionalName {
    print("Hello, \(name)")
} else {
    print("No name provided.")
}

Force unwrap (use carefully):

let unwrappedName = optionalName!



Error Handling
	•	Define custom errors:

enum FileError: Error {
    case notFound
    case unreadable
}

	•	Throwing functions:

func readFile(named fileName: String) throws -> String {
    guard fileName != "" else {
        throw FileError.notFound
    }
    return "file contents"
}

	•	Handling errors with do-catch:

do {
    let contents = try readFile(named: "notes.txt")
    print(contents)
} catch FileError.notFound {
    print("File not found.")
} catch {
    print("Unknown error.")
}



Protocols and Extensions
	•	Protocols define blueprints for methods and properties:

protocol Drivable {
    func drive()
}

struct Bike: Drivable {
    func drive() {
        print("Biking around")
    }
}

	•	Extensions add functionality to existing types:

extension String {
    func shout() -> String {
        return self.uppercased() + "!"
    }
}

print("hello".shout()) // Outputs "HELLO!"



Memory Management (ARC)
	•	Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to manage memory:
	•	Ensure no strong reference cycles by using weak or unowned references.

class Person {
    var name: String
    weak var apartment: Apartment?

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}



Swift Standard Library and SwiftUI
	•	The Swift Standard Library includes:
	•	Collections (Array, Set, Dictionary)
	•	Higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce)

Example:

let filtered = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].filter { $0 > 3 }

	•	SwiftUI for UI development:
	•	Declarative UI framework

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello, SwiftUI!")
                .padding()
            Button("Tap me") {
                print("Tapped!")
            }
        }
    }
}



Best Practices
	•	Favor immutability (let) over mutability (var) whenever possible.
	•	Use meaningful, clear variable and function names.
	•	Avoid force-unwrapping optionals unless absolutely certain of non-nil state.
	•	Leverage Swift’s safety features, like type inference and automatic reference counting.


Swift Version and Platform Support
	•	Swift is currently at version 5.10 (as of early 2025).
	•	Ensure compatibility across iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS by reviewing Apple’s latest SDK documentation.


Swift Agent Reminder: Always reference this guide thoroughly before providing Swift assistance. Maintain accurate syntax, provide clean and idiomatic solutions, and adhere strictly to best practices outlined here.
